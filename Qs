normfactors, jags vs. stan
- questions from analysis: why is jags so bad? 
  - to explore
    - no random effects
    - more genes per sample
    - larger sample effects

comparing random effects, stan vs. edgeR
- how do we compare pair effect estimates between models with different design matrices? 
  - edgeR uses full rank model matrix
    - the first pair is rolled up into the overall baseline level, i.e. we don't estimate a pair effect separate from the intercept for this pair
  - stan uses leq full rank model matrix, and so estimates one more random effect
    - unique effect for each pair, in this case
- ideas:
  - predicted values for each trt:pair combination
  - differencing coef estimates from edgeR might result in an estimate that is 1:1 comparable to stan for SOME of the pair effects (but not the first one, right?)
  
stan vs. edgeR
- need to make the simulated data set more difficult
- need to explore normfactors questions

what would I like in our discussion for next Tuesday? 
- stan vs. edgeR comparison
  - simulated data that is more difficult for the models 
  - also more tags
  - also real data based if possible
  - show differences in random effect estimates (would like to find a reason to prefer stan's abilities here) 
  - show differences in fixed effect estimates (looks promising for stan)
  - show differences in FDR, ROC (looks promising for stan)

effect size simulation
- if we don't really believe the sharp null + a minimum FC cutoff matches reality,
what do we believe?
