dialing it in
- attempt 1: M = 1
  - perfect separation for both methods
  - stan b1 estimates are much better
  - stan FDR estimate is better, but both are liberal
    - perfect separation might mess with the value of this plot

- attempt 2: M = 0.7
  - reasonable roc curves, stan slightly better
  - stan b1 estimates are slightly better (eR overest)
  - stan FDR estimate is better
  - normfactors on / off for eR doesn't make a big difference; on might help slightly
  
- attempt 3: M = 0.7, pi0 = 0.8, G = 250 
  - two component b1 prior is horrible
  
- attempt 4: option to turn off two component b1 prior, M = 0.7, pi0 = 0.8, G = 250

- queue
  - larger G
  - larger pi0 (0.8), i.e. greater proportion null tags
