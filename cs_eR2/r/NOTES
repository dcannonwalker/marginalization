dialing it in
- attempt 1: M = 1
  - perfect separation for both methods
  - stan b1 estimates are much better
  - stan FDR estimate is better, but both are liberal
    - perfect separation might mess with the value of this plot

- attempt 2: M = 0.7
  - reasonable roc curves, stan slightly better
  - stan b1 estimates are slightly better (eR overest)
  - stan FDR estimate is better
  - normfactors on / off for eR doesn't make a big difference; on might help slightly

- queue
  - larger G
  - smaller pi0 (0.2 or 0.1)
